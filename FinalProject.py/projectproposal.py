
#1. My project is going to be a video game concept sort of like street fighter. I am also working on a mini project in getting a website up and implementing my game into the site.

#2. My first major milestone is going to make my character move.

#3 What I do not know now is how to add in the animations for each punch or attack.

#4 Some ways that I think my project is too ambitious is that I would have to make my own images.

#5 I feel that I should be adding more characters.
